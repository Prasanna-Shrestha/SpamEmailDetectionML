This project is a Spam Email detection ML algorithm.
In this project, the dataset is downloaded from Kaggle, consisting of two main columns;
the first column v1 has the information about whether the email is spam or ham(not spam), and
the second column v2 has the actual email.
Using different models the accuracy will be compared and the appropriate model will be listed out
